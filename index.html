			<p>The United States today has seen an increase in inequality over the last thirty years, and especially in the years following the financial crisis of 2008. The main complaint is that the rich have been getting richer while the poor have been getting poorer; the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening. </p>
			<p>There are two different interrelating ‘gaps’ that have been widening; the first is the income gap, and the second is the wealth gap. Most measures of inequality, like the GINI index, measure the income gap and determine a country’s level of inequality. However, we believe the wealth gap to be a better measure of inequality, and in the United States, the wealth gap is quite large and growing.</p>
