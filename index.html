			<h2>Capital Gains</h2>
			<p>What are "capital gains"? A capital gain is the profit that you make from the sale of a piece of property or an investment that you own.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>The United States today has seen an increase in inequality over the last thirty years, and especially in the years following the financial crisis of 2008. The main complaint is that the rich have been getting richer while the poor have been getting poorer; the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening. </p>
			<p>There are two different interrelating ‘gaps’ that have been widening; the first is the income gap, and the second is the wealth gap. Most measures of inequality, like the GINI index, measure the income gap and determine a country’s level of inequality. However, we believe the wealth gap to be a better measure of inequality, and in the United States, the wealth gap is quite large and growing.</p>
			<p>Part of the reason this gap is growing is partly because of the low income taxes, but also because of capital gains. A capital gain is the profit from the sale of property or an investment Some people in the United States, like former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, make most of their money from capital gains. In 2011, Mitt Romney generated outrage when he revealed he had paid only 14.1% in taxes---and made $13.69 million from capital gains. Meanwhile, many Americans are barely making a living wage, have barely enough money (if any at all) to put into savings, and most don’t even think about investing. The only form of capital gains they will ever make is from selling their house; and yet, those making as low as $37,000 a year (above the poverty level, but still living frugally, with some financial stress) are required to pay a 15% tax on the profit they gain from selling their house. This tax rate---15%---is the same rate people pay when their normal income is about $400,000.</p>
			<p>People that have an annual income of over $400,000 only have a tax rate of 20% on income received from long term capital gains, which is almost half of the 39.60% tax rate that they are supposed to be paying for ordinary income. Given the opportunity, most if not all of the people in the highest tax bracket would rather receive the majority of their income through capital gains rather than through ordinary income due to the lower tax rate on money made from buy and selling stocks.</p>
			<p>The capital gains tax is flawed because it harms both middle and lower class American citizens by forcing them to pay the same percentage of what little long term capital gains that they make as the upper class that receives almost all of their income through capital gains. On top of this, the extremely wealthy are able to avoid paying the taxes that they are meant to be paying by avoiding ordinary income altogether.</p>
