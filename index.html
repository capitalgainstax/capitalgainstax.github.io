			<h2>Explanation</h2>
				<h3>Capital Gains</h3>
					<p>What are "capital gains"? A capital gain is the profit that you make from the sale of a piece of property or an investment that you own.</p>
					<ul>
  					<li>Bonds</li>
  					<li>Property</li>
  					<li>Company Stocks</li>
						<li>Precious Metals</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A capital gain is not actually “realized” or acknowledged until the sale of your asset. This means that you haven’t made a capital gain until you actually sell your property or investment, regardless of what the current market price of what you own is in comparison to the original amount of money that the asset cost you to begin with.</p>
					<p>If you were to purchase a house for $800,000, and then proceed to sell it for $1,000,000 several years down the line, the $200,000 that you made from the sale is considered a capital gain because you sold a piece of property (the house) for a larger sum of money than the amount of money that you originally purchased it for.</p>
				<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>
					<p>The capital gains tax is a tax on capital gains, and only needs to be paid when you sell an asset for more than the amount that you originally purchased it for. In cases when you might need to sell an asset for less than you bought it for, it is considered a capital loss, and is not taxed. Capital gains are purposefully taxed at a low rate in the United States supposedly to promote investment in the economy.</p>
					<p>If you were to buy an Apple stock at about $104, wait a year, and sell it at $204, the $100 of profit you make by selling the Apple stock is considered a capital gain. Depending on your current income, you may be required to pay a 15% tax on the profit made through the sale. That tax would then be a capital gains tax.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>The United States today has seen an increase in inequality over the last thirty years, and especially in the years following the financial crisis of 2008. The main complaint is that the rich have been getting richer while the poor have been getting poorer; the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening. </p>
				<p>There are two different interrelating ‘gaps’ that have been widening; the first is the income gap, and the second is the wealth gap. Most measures of inequality, like the GINI index, measure the income gap and determine a country’s level of inequality. However, we believe the wealth gap to be a better measure of inequality, and in the United States, the wealth gap is quite large and growing.</p>
				<p>Part of the reason this gap is growing is partly because of the low income taxes, but also because of capital gains. A capital gain is the profit from the sale of property or an investment Some people in the United States, like former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, make most of their money from capital gains. In 2011, Mitt Romney generated outrage when he revealed he had paid only 14.1% in taxes---and made $13.69 million from capital gains. Meanwhile, many Americans are barely making a living wage, have barely enough money (if any at all) to put into savings, and most don’t even think about investing. The only form of capital gains they will ever make is from selling their house; and yet, those making as low as $37,000 a year (above the poverty level, but still living frugally, with some financial stress) are required to pay a 15% tax on the profit they gain from selling their house. This tax rate---15%---is the same rate people pay when their normal income is about $400,000.</p>
				<p>People that have an annual income of over $400,000 only have a tax rate of 20% on income received from long term capital gains, which is almost half of the 39.60% tax rate that they are supposed to be paying for ordinary income. Given the opportunity, most if not all of the people in the highest tax bracket would rather receive the majority of their income through capital gains rather than through ordinary income due to the lower tax rate on money made from buy and selling stocks.</p>
				<p>The capital gains tax is flawed because it harms both middle and lower class American citizens by forcing them to pay the same percentage of what little long term capital gains that they make as the upper class that receives almost all of their income through capital gains. On top of this, the extremely wealthy are able to avoid paying the taxes that they are meant to be paying by avoiding ordinary income altogether.</p>

		<div id="solution">
			<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<p>Revising the tax code to instate a steeply graduated capital gains tax would help to reduce inequality. People in higher income brackets would have to pay up a higher percentage of the money that they gain through capital gains whereas those in the lower brackets would have their taxes on capital gains reduced. To put things into perspective, only about 5% of Americans are in the 20% capital gains tax bracket. A more graduated capital gains tax would both prevent people in the lower bracket from falling further into poverty, and prevent the wealthy from taking advantage of the low flat tax rate on capital gains. The increased amount of money received from those in the higher brackets could be put toward improving K-12 education and reducing tuition for public higher education.</p>

			<h2>How to Help</h2>
				<p>Making changes to the country’s tax code is achievable. If you want to help, you can contact your representative about your concerns with the current state of the country’s capital gains tax. Getting Congress involved with this issue is the first step that needs to be taken in order to correct this problem. With enough voices speaking up, we can move closer toward a more graduated capital gains tax and an overall more equal society.</p>
				<p>You can find your representative's contact information at http://www.house.gov/ by entering your zip code in the box located at the top-right corner of the site's home page.</p>

				<p>Another way to help is by voting Democrat in this year’s election. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have currently proposed to make changes to the capital gains tax, with Clinton aiming to raise the tax on assets sold soon after they are purchased and Sanders raising the tax for people in the upper brackets.</p>
