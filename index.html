		<p>You might be a millionaire...if you only pay 20% in taxes.</p>
 
		<p>Have you ever considered the fact that regardless of your current economic status, there is a high chance that you might be paying a larger percentage of your income in taxes than the richest people in the United States?</p>
 
		<p>Capital gains tax in the United States affects people from a wide variety of economic backgrounds in exactly the same manner, resulting in both U.S. citizens making as little as $40,000 annually paying the same 15% in capital gains taxes when they are forced to sell their homes as the wealthy when they decide to sell their assets. The majority of people in the U.S. are grouped into the 15% bracket, which ranges from $37,650 to $415,050 in annual income. Anyone in the highest bracket ($415,050 and above) only has to pay a 20% flat tax on capital gains. In comparison to this, the tax rate on ordinary income for people making $91,150 annually is currently 28%.</p>

		<div id="what are caital gains?">
			<h2>What are “capital gains”?</h2>
				<p>A capital gain is the profit that you make from the sale of a piece of property or an investment that you own. Examples of investments include company stocks, bonds, and precious metals. A capital gain is not actually “realized” or acknowledged until the sale of your asset. This means that you haven’t made a capital gain until you actually sell your property or investment, regardless of what the current market price of what you own is in comparison to the original amount of money that the asset cost you to begin with.</p>
 
				<p>If you were to purchase a house for $800,000, and then proceed to sell it for $1,000,000 several years down the line, the $200,000 that you made from the sale is considered a capital gain because you sold a piece of property (the house) for a larger sum of money than the amount of money that you originally purchased it for.</p>

			<h2>What is a “capital gains tax"?</h2>
				<p>The capital gains tax is a tax on capital gains, and only needs to be paid when you sell an asset for more than the amount that you originally purchased it for. In cases when you might need to sell an asset for less than you bought it for, it is considered a capital loss, and is not taxed. Capital gains are purposefully taxed at a low rate in the United States supposedly to promote investment in the economy.</p>
 
				<p>If you were to buy an Apple stock at about $104, wait a year, and sell it at $204, the $100 of profit you make by selling the Apple stock is considered a capital gain. Depending on your current income, you may be required to pay a 15% tax on the profit made through the sale. That tax would then be a capital gains tax.</p>

		<div id="How is a flat rate tax a bad thing?">
			<h2>How is a flat rate tax a bad thing?</h2>
				<p>Although a somewhat low flat rate tax sounds like something good, it’s important to note that people who have an annual income of around $400,000 are paying the same percentage of their income from capital gains in taxes as people only make $40,000 a year. On top of this, the only capital assets that people in the lower tax brackets own tend to be their homes. The rich make most of their income by buying and selling stocks. People that make enough money to invest in companies are able to avoid paying higher taxes involved with regular employment by making their money from capital gains alone, which allows them to pay taxes at a rate less than working class Americans. People making well above $400,000 annually are supposed to be paying a 39.60% tax rate on regular income, but are instead paying only 20%</p>

		<div id="What can be done to solve this issue?">
			<h2>What can be done to solve this issue?</h2>
			<p>Revising the tax code to instate a steeply graduated capital gains tax would help to reduce inequality. People in higher income brackets would have to pay up a higher percentage of the money that they gain through capital gains whereas those in the lower brackets would have their taxes on capital gains reduced. To put things into perspective, only about 5% of Americans are in the 20% capital gains tax bracket. A more graduated capital gains tax would both prevent people in the lower bracket from falling further into poverty, and prevent the wealthy from taking advantage of the low flat tax rate on capital gains. The increased amount of money received from those in the higher brackets could be put toward improving K-12 education and reducing tuition for public higher education.</p>

			<h2>What can I do to help?</h2>
			<p>Making changes to the country’s tax code is achievable. If you want to help, you can contact your representative about your concerns with the current state of the country’s capital gains tax. Getting Congress involved with this issue is the first step that needs to be taken in order to correct this problem. With enough voices speaking up, we can move closer toward a more graduated capital gains tax and an overall more equal society.</p>
			<p>You can find your representative's contact information <a href="http://www.house.gov/" target="_blank">here</a> by entering your zip code in the box located at the top-right corner of the site's home page.</p>
			<p>Another way to help is by voting Democrat in this year’s election. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have currently proposed to make changes to the capital gains tax, with Clinton aiming to raise the tax on assets sold soon after they are purchased and Sanders raising the tax for people in the upper brackets.</p>
